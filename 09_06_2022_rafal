I woke up at 8 am and I ate a breakfast. 
I watched a movie on youtube, about a football world. 
And I drank a coffe during watching the video. 
I was trying to configure a git tool.

I was at work. I called to a labor office.
I was drinking an alcohol. I had a good fun.
I dance on a floor with my girlfriend.
